Includes constants such as pi and e for use in calculations
Provides error handling to prevent invalid calculations
Can perform mathematical operation on voice commands


#### How to Use
To use the calculator, simply enter a mathematical expression using the buttons provided. You can click on the buttons to input different functions and operators, and the calculator will update the input field accordingly. When you are ready to perform the calculation, click the equals (=) button to see the result.

You can switch between degrees and radians by clicking on the "deg" and "rad" buttons, respectively.

If you make a mistake while entering an expression, you can use the "CE" button to clear the last entry or the "C" button to clear the entire input field.

You can use the microphone button to give vioce commands to the calculator. A sample command: "What is 2 plus 2?"
